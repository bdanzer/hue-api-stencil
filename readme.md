This app allows you to control Hue lights that have been added already.

## Requirements
You'll need a Hue API bridge and a light that has already been paired.

## Installation
* `git clone <repo>`
* `cd <into-cloned-dir>`
* `npm install`
* `npm start`

Once up, you can press the hue api button and connect locally to control the lights in your house.
